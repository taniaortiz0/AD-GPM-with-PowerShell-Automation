Configured Windows Server 2022 as my Domain Controller (DC) and this will be utilized as the Default Gateway for the two NICs.

Included two Network Adapters, one is to attach to NAT (Internet) and other one is to the Internal Network (Isolated). 
I then configured the Internal Network to set up the IP address, subnet mask, and DNS.
